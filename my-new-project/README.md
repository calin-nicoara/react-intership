## Exercise 1 Application description

- Create a simple user management app
    - User form with two inputs: username and age
    - inputs should have validation:
        - username must have at least a non-space character
        - age must be greater or equal to 13
    - When an error occurs, an error message should be shown (Ex. age is less than 13)
    - When the user is valid and the submit button is pressed, the
        user should be added to a list shown on the UI
    - There should also be a placeholder for when there are no users present
